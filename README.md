⚠️ Note: Changing brightness values, for this script, to zero will blackout monitors and you will need to ctrl + alt +F2, put in your username, put in your password, then pkill -f fade-monitors-auto-sd.sh, then (ctrl + alt + F1) or sometimes (ctrl + alt + F7). This will TEMPORARILY kill script and you can change values from script and restart computer.


⚠️ Note: version does not implement single-instance locking. Running multiple Fade Monitor scripts simultaneously may cause gamma or brightness flashes.
